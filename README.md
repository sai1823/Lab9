Dashboard
This code will generate a dashboard with two plots: 
1)a bar graph showing the number of movies released in the last n years, where n can be selected by the user in the sidebar.
2)a graph showing the movies released in each year sorted from highest to lowest.
The new "Movie Names" tab will display a table of movie names for a selected year, and the user can select the year using a slider input. 
The "Movie Names" tab will only be visible when the user selects "Movie Names" as the plot type.
